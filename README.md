## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib are needed to run the code beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand how to hire a developer without overspending.
This can be done by understanding what else apart from money can attrackt applicants and gaining a better understanding of the budget that should be planned for a certain experience level.

The resulting three questions to address these points of interest are:
1. Which benefits apart from salary are important to the respondents?
2. Of those who earn a lot / average / less than average, what are their priorities for non-financial benefits?
3. What salary can a company expect to budget for what experience level (experience measured by years in coding job)?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

I have chosen to provide a single notebook that addresses all of the above questions to avoid switching between notebooks too much. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

Since this nanodegree is an educational project from our company, we are not allowed to share details under our name publicly.
This is why I have chosen to add the article for this project as a PDF within the GitHub project.
